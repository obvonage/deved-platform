## Introduction

Today, I will introduce a starter template for creating a Vonage Messages API activity in the Salesforce Marketing Cloud Journey Builder using Heroku. The custom activity allows you to send marketing campaign messages using Vonage Messages API and Salesforce Marketing Cloud Contacts (Attribute Group in Contact Builder).

In this post, I will walk you through the creation of the activity step by step. I have also put together a short video that you can learn how to integrate Vonage Communication APIs into Salesforce Marketing Cloud to build a contextual customer journey with different channels.

![Journey Builder - Entry Source](/content/blog/build-a-vonage-message-custom-activity-with-salesforce-marketing-cloud/da-and-journey.png "da-and-journey.png")

### Sending a campaign via SMS or WhatsApp Message

Back in the package, you dragged `Vonage SFMC`. You can send either an SMS or WhatsApp Template Message.

**Option 1:** If SMS is selected, a message body will appear. Copy the line below and edit `DATA_EXTENSION_NAME` to yours.

* Hi there `{{Contact.Attribute.DATA_EXTENSION_NAME.firstName}}`, are you interested in a 75% promotion?

Marketing Cloud uses Data Binding using the Mustache syntax. E.g. `{{Contact.Attribute.DATA_EXTENSION_NAME.firstName}}`

![Vonage SFMC](/content/blog/build-a-vonage-message-custom-activity-with-salesforce-marketing-cloud/journey-sms.png "journey-sms.png")

* Click Done once you pasted the line.

**Option 2:** If WhatsApp is selected, the WhatsApp Template you created earlier will be used.

* e.g. Hi there `{{1}}`, are you interested in a `{{2}}` promotion?
* Select WhatsApp. The WhatsApp Template message has two parameters. `{{1}}` is the `{{Contact.Attribute.DATA_EXTENSION_NAME.firstName}}`and `{{2}}` is the `client-ref`.
* The Client Ref will be the second parameter for the WhatsApp Template.

## Wrap-up

As you can see, we can use Salesforce Marketing Cloud to leverage Vonage Messages API to send and receive messages. It is a powerful way to send marketing campaigns to a number of customers quickly and easily. 

To take this further, you can use [Vonage AI Studio](https://studio.docs.ai.vonage.com/) to form engaging conversation from Inbound replies. You can also add multiple Data Extensions to a [Contact Builder](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_cab_contact_builder.htm&type=5) Attribute Group and link them, which would allow you to send messages like this: e.g. Hello {{Contact.Attribute.DATA_EXT_1.FirstName}}. Join us at this event {{Contact.Attribute.DATA_EXT_2.EventName}}.
