## Introduction

I've recently begun exploring [Vonage AI Studio](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/studio). Using AI Studio, I built a Virtual Agent for a fictitious event that allowed a customer to ask questions regarding the event's logistics. They would get a reply with the information requested. I wrote about my initial experiences in a blog post, "[If You Can Point and Click, Then You Can Make a Conversational AI](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/22/09/13/if-you-can-point-and-click-then-you-can-make-a-conversational-ai)." During that whole process, I came across a number of features that are super-useful. I thought it would be helpful to summarize these features as five tips for anyone getting started with AI Studio!

But before we do that, for those that don't know, [Vonage AI Studio](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/studio) is a Low Code / No-code conversation designer that empowers developers and non-developers to design, create and deploy Virtual Assistants that operate in natural language. It uses your Vonage API account to create customer engagements over voice, SMS, HTTP, and WhatsApp channels.

Let's jump into the tips! 

## Tip #1 - Learn how to easily Export and Import Agents

Maybe you'd like to export your Virtual Agent after creation, keep it on your servers, or import it to a different account. Thankfully, this is straightforward to do. Navigate to your **Agents**  list, click on the three dots next to the agent name and select **Export Agent**. 

![Export Agent Option](/content/blog/5-things-you-probably-didn’t-know-about-vonage-ai-studio/export-agent.png "export-agent.png")

After a few minutes, you'll see an email from `ai.vonage.com` with the Subject, "Your Agent is ready!". Click on the download link to save your Agent to your local computer.

![Export Agent Email Sample](/content/blog/5-things-you-probably-didn’t-know-about-vonage-ai-studio/export-agent-email.png "export-agent-email.png")

Once you download your Vonage AI Agent, you can import it back into AI Studio anytime. If you are curious as to what the `.zip` file contains, you'll see the following structure:

```text
C:\Vonage\ai-structure>tree /f
Folder PATH listing
Volume serial number is F650-8A54
C:.
│   Agent.json
│   nlu-application.zip
│   version.json
│
└───files
```

Below is a summary of what each file does:

* The `Agent.json` contains information about the Agent that you specified during the Agent creation process. Items such as the Agent Name, Language, TimeZone, etc. 
* The `nlu-application.zip` contains two files: the `<id>.json` and a `signature.sig`. The `<id>.json` contains application-specific information, `intents`, and `entities`, whereas the `signature.sig` is the application's signature.

The `version.json` contain information specific to the different versions that your Agent has. There is more to come on this topic later. 

Now that we know how to **Export an Agent** let's cover **Importing** one. 

Thankfully, this is just as easy. Once logged into [AI Studio](https://studio.ai.vonage.com/Agents), you'll see an option to **Import Agent** besides the Create Agent button. 

![Import Agent Option](/content/blog/5-things-you-probably-didn’t-know-about-vonage-ai-studio/import-agent.png "import-agent.png")

You'll see an option to upload an Agent, go ahead and upload the Agent that you downloaded from the step above and now you will have the opportunity to update the : 

* Agent Name: Give your Agent a unique name you haven't used before.
* Region: Where will your Agent typically be used - The USA or Europe?
* Time Zone: Choose the time zone where your Agent will operate.

![Import Agent Dialog Box](/content/blog/5-things-you-probably-didn’t-know-about-vonage-ai-studio/import-agent-dialog.png "import-agent-dialog.png")

Finally, press **Import Agent**, and your new Agent will be listed.

![Imported Agent Successfully](/content/blog/5-things-you-probably-didn’t-know-about-vonage-ai-studio/agent-imported-successfully.png "agent-imported-successfully.png")

**Note** - After creating your Agent, you need to set a phone number.

## Tip #2 - See transcripts of past SMS conversations for reporting or troubleshooting

Sometimes you need to view past SMS conversations between a user and your virtual Agent for reporting or troubleshooting purposes. Select the **Agent** from which you want to view the conversation data and click on **Reports** from the top menu navigation. 

![Reports](/content/blog/5-things-you-probably-didn’t-know-about-vonage-ai-studio/reports.png "reports.png")

You can filter reports by **Session ID** or the **Caller Number**. Regardless of which item is selected, you'll see a **Search** box where you can enter information. 

![Filter Reports](/content/blog/5-things-you-probably-didn’t-know-about-vonage-ai-studio/filter-report.png "filter-report.png")

Before you search, you'll see a **Generate Report** option on the right-hand side that allows you to filter the data shown. You will have the following options:

* Region: The USA or Europe
* Report Type: A variety of different [options](https://studio.docs.ai.vonage.com/ai-studio/reports) depending on your needs
* Date and Time: The Start Date and the End Date
* Agents: Which Virtual Agents would you like to run the report?
* Time Zone: The time zone that you'd like to filter.
* Report State: You can choose between **Success**, **Warning**, **Error**, or **All**.

![Generate Report Filter Options](/content/blog/5-things-you-probably-didn’t-know-about-vonage-ai-studio/generate-report.png "generate-report.png")

Once you press **Apply**, you will see if the data exists, as shown below.

![Reports Results](/content/blog/5-things-you-probably-didn’t-know-about-vonage-ai-studio/report-results.png "report-results.png")

If you click on the **ID**, you'll see details such as the **Caller phone**, **Agent phone**, **Session ID**, and a **Transcript** of the recorded conversation. 

![Reports Details](/content/blog/5-things-you-probably-didn’t-know-about-vonage-ai-studio/report-details.png "report-details.png")

You can also view the **Parameters** data captured and review the **Flow Path** that the Virtual Agent took them through. Very cool!

## Tip #3 - You can quickly go back to previous versions of an Agent

Let's say you'd like to look at a previous version of your Virtual Agent to revert a change. If you click on the three dots on the top of the page next to the Agent's name, you'll see  **Versions**.

![Versions Option](/content/blog/5-things-you-probably-didn’t-know-about-vonage-ai-studio/versions.png "versions.png")

You'll see a list of **Versions**; if you click on it, you can view it inside the designer. By default, the current view will be your most recent published version. 

![Click on Versions](/content/blog/5-things-you-probably-didn’t-know-about-vonage-ai-studio/click-on-versions.png "click-on-versions.png")

If you want to revert to a previous version, you can click on the three dots next to the version and select "**Open in editor**." We'll do this for **Version 1** of our SMS Virtual Agent. 

![Open in Editor](/content/blog/5-things-you-probably-didn’t-know-about-vonage-ai-studio/open-in-editor.png "open-in-editor.png")

You'll see a dialog box warning below that any unsaved changes will be lost if you proceed. 

![Dialog to Save New Version](/content/blog/5-things-you-probably-didn’t-know-about-vonage-ai-studio/dialog-save-new-version.png "dialog-save-new-version.png")

 Click "Back to Editor" on the top left to begin working with the previous version. 

![Restored Version](/content/blog/5-things-you-probably-didn’t-know-about-vonage-ai-studio/restored-version.png "restored-version.png")

## Tip #4 - Would you prefer an actual voice vs. using text-to-speech?

AI Studio's text-to-speech feature is awesome, but sometimes you might prefer to give your customers a human voice vs. using text-to-speech for your conversation flow. You can do this simply by looking under **Properties**, then **Recordings**. 

![Recordings Option](/content/blog/5-things-you-probably-didn’t-know-about-vonage-ai-studio/recordings.png "recordings.png")

You can **Drag and Drop** an audio file on the **Recordings** dialog. 

![Recordings Dialog](/content/blog/5-things-you-probably-didn’t-know-about-vonage-ai-studio/recordings-dialog.png "recordings-dialog.png")

**Quick Tip:** Please note that the supported file types are wav, mp3, and ogg and that files may not be larger than four MB in file size.

Once you've uploaded your file, you can preview it and see a **Transcript** of the audio. 

![Uploaded Recording](/content/blog/5-things-you-probably-didn’t-know-about-vonage-ai-studio/uploaded-recording.png "uploaded-recording.png")

Using a **Telephony** Agent, you'll see the **Speak** node under **Conversation**. Select this and drag and drop it onto the designer. 

![Speak Node](/content/blog/5-things-you-probably-didn’t-know-about-vonage-ai-studio/speak-node.png "speak-node.png")

Click on **Speak 1**, and you'll see an option to select **Audio**. Under **Use Recording**, you'll see the recording  you uploaded from the earlier step. 

![Selecting an Audio Recording](/content/blog/5-things-you-probably-didn’t-know-about-vonage-ai-studio/selecting-audio-recording.png "selecting-audio-recording.png")

Select **Done** and then **Save & Exit**.

## Tip #5 - Integrations

Sometimes you will need a third-party service to send and receive data. Vonage AI Studio has several **Integration** nodes that you can use. 

![Integrations](/content/blog/5-things-you-probably-didn’t-know-about-vonage-ai-studio/integrations.png "integrations.png")

There are three main types at the time of writing this blog post: 

1. Webhook - It supports multiple ways to send an API request, such as **GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH**. It also provides support for **HTTP headers** and **Response Mapping**. 

A built-in way to test your Webhook is by clicking on **Test Request** on the top right of the node settings. 

![WebHook](/content/blog/5-things-you-probably-didn’t-know-about-vonage-ai-studio/webhook.png "webhook.png")

2. Salesforce Authentication - This node handles the required authentication to access your Salesforce domain.

![Salesforce Authentication](/content/blog/5-things-you-probably-didn’t-know-about-vonage-ai-studio/salesforce-authentication.png "salesforce-authentication.png")

3. Salesforce Actions - The Salesforce Action node allows you to retrieve, create and update a record via SOQL query.
