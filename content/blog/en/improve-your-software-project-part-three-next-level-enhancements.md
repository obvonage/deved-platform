Have you ever taken over a codebase and realised that you're not happy with how the code is written or organised? It's a common story, but one that can cause a lot of headaches. Technical debt can snowball, making it exponentially harder to understand the code and add new features.

In this three-part series, I'll walk through some of the key things you'll want to do to become happier with your shiny (old) project. To give some concrete examples, I'll tie everything together by explaining how I refactored and enhanced the open-source [Vonage Python SDK](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-python-sdk), a library that makes HTTP calls to Vonage APIs, but the principles apply to any kind of software project. 

The examples in this post will be written in Python, but these principles apply to projects in any language. There's also [a handy checklist to follow](https://github.com/maxkahan/updating-an-old-project) if you're specifically trying to fix a Python project.

## The series, in sections

1. [Part One: Understanding a Codebase](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/22/11/15/improve-your-software-project-part-one-understanding-a-codebase)
2. [Part Two: Making Changes](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/22/11/28/improve-your-software-project-part-two-making-changes)
3. Part Three: Taking Things to the Next Level, And Handing Over (this article)

If you followed [Part One](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/22/11/15/improve-your-software-project-part-one-understanding-a-codebase) and [Part Two](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/22/11/28/improve-your-software-project-part-two-making-changes) of this series, you'll have a good understanding of your project and may have already done some refactoring, added features and released new versions.

## What does Part Three cover?

In Part Three, we'll talk about:

* Enhancing your project
* Tooling that you can use
* Automation
* Best practices for handing over a project to someone else

### Enhancements you can make

When thinking about enhancements that can be made to a codebase, they fall into two groups:

* Enhancements that directly benefit the user, and
* Enhancements that benefit the maintainer.

Let's start by discussing some user enhancements.

## Custom error handling

When a user encounters an error, how useful that error is to help them discover what's wrong can vary wildly. Let's consider two distinct examples.

Exhibit A shows one way to write a function that checks for a valid input parameter to a method. The method in question allows a user to send messages via channels such as SMS, MMS, WhatsApp, Messenger and Viber with the [Vonage Messages API](https://developer.vonage.com/messages/overview). This check makes sure they've specified a valid channel.

```python
def _check_valid_message_channel(self, params):
    if params['channel'] not in Messages.valid_message_channels:
        raise Exception
```

In this case, if the user doesn't specify a valid message channel, they will simply see that an exception has been raised. They won't have any specific information here and will have to dig through their call stack to see what caused the error.

![The exception a user will see if they run the above code](/content/blog/improve-your-software-project-part-three-next-level-enhancements/exception.png)

Exhibit B shows another way to write this code.

```python
from .errors import MessagesError
def _check_valid_message_channel(self, params):
    if params['channel'] not in Messages.valid_message_channels:
        raise MessagesError(f"""
          '{params['channel']}' is an invalid message channel. 
          Must be one of the following types: {self.valid_message_channels}'
        """)
```

In this case, I created a custom error related to the Vonage Messages API. I specify an error message that describes the exact problem with the user's code, and what they can do to fix it. This is much clearer for the user and can save them serious debugging time!

![The (more useful) exception a user will see if they run the new code with the custom error class](/content/blog/improve-your-software-project-part-three-next-level-enhancements/custom-error.png)

We can see above that the user tried to send a "carrier pigeon" message via the Messages API, which is an unsupported channel. This example shows how much you can help your users if you create custom exceptions to help with debugging.

## Input validation

If your users have to pass in data to functions in your code, you might want to consider what checks you're doing on that input data. If you're using a strongly-typed class-based approach, like Object-Oriented Java, your code will try to marshal the input data into an appropriate structure. If you're using a less strict approach, you may want to validate user input to return an error as soon as possible if things aren't right.

Let's look at a couple of real examples. This is some code from the SDK that sends an SMS:

```python
def send_message(self, params):
    ...
    return self._client.post(
        self._client.host(), 
        "/sms/json", 
        params, # This is the user's input!
        supports_signature_auth=True,
        **Sms.defaults,
    )
```

If you call this method, these things happen:

1. `params` are passed into the `sms.send_message` function by the user
1. These values are immediately passed into another function, the `post` method of the `client` class
1. The `post` method makes a post request and returns the response to the user. 

During this process, the user input is assigned immediately to the `params` object without any validation. This is fine for simple cases, but if the API we're communicating with accepts many combinations of options, we may want to consider validating user input.

### Why bother validating input?

Great question. If all we're going to do is throw an error anyway, why bother? Well, this is a perfect example of the ["fail-fast" approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast): catching errors at the root of the problem makes debugging a lot easier, and means fewer resources are used to make requests that will be rejected.

Here's another example, this time from the [Vonage Messages API](https://developer.vonage.com/messages/overview):

```python
def send_message(self, params: dict):        
    self.validate_send_message_input(params) # This calls the function below
    ...
    return self._client.post(
        self._client.api_host(), 
        "/v1/messages",
        params, # This is still the user's input, but if we get here, we know it's valid!
        auth_type=self._auth_type,
        )
def validate_send_message_input(self, params):
    # Each of these lines calls a different check on the user's input
    # An error is thrown if any of the checks fail
    self._check_input_is_dict(params)
    self._check_valid_message_channel(params)
    self._check_valid_message_type(params)
    self._check_valid_recipient(params)
    self._check_valid_sender(params)
    self._channel_specific_checks(params)
    self._check_valid_client_ref(params)
```

We can see that this time a user's input is carefully checked so we don't send an erroneous request.

Whilst writing manual checks is effective, it's also worth considering a class- or model-based approach if you have to validate a lot of user input. Some languages have this function implemented via strongly-typed classes, where the constructor of a class expects specific input to create an instance of that class. In this case, having the user create valid classes and passing those to your other functions can ensure the user passes in the right data. In Python, we don't have an out-of-the-box typing system that works in this way, but there are [libraries such as Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) that can create models to do this for you.

I've rewritten the code above using a model-based approach with Pydantic to use models for input validation:

```python
# I created models (that look like classes) that inherit from Pydantic's BaseModel class.
# I'm able to specify specific constraints, including the type and length of parameters, and specify defaults.
class Message(BaseModel):
    to: constr(min_length=7, max_length=15)
    sender: constr(min_length=1)
    client_ref: Optional[str]
    
class SmsMessage(Message): # Inherits the properties of the "Message" model
    channel = Field(default='sms', const=True)
    message_type = Field(default='text', const=True)
    text: constr(max_length=1000)
... # More classes for each type of message that the Messages API can send
class Messages: # Class that contains the code to call the Messages API
... # Skipping showing the constructor etc. here
    def send_message_from_model(self, message: Message):
        params = message.dict()
        ...
        return self._client.post(
            self._client.api_host(), 
            "/v1/messages",
            params,
            auth_type=self._auth_type,
        )
```

This version may look more complicated than the one above, but it saves us manually writing all of the checks. Now if a user wants to send a message and gets part of the input wrong, they'll get a sensible error that indicates what they might have done wrong.

![The exception generated by Pydantic](/content/blog/improve-your-software-project-part-three-next-level-enhancements/pydantic-error.png)

Now, validation is tightly coupled to class instantiation. In the previous implementation, validation had to be written manually and wasn't mandatory. Using this model-based approach with Pydantic, we can guarantee that there's no chance of passing invalid inputs any further.

In summary, when dealing with user input, consider validating it. How you do that validation depends on your language and the approach you've taken with it, but having some form of validation can save a lot of your users' time.

## Making it async

The final potential user-facing enhancement I want to identify is to do with asynchronous code. Unless your project deals with io-bound operations, you might not need to consider this at all - in which case, just skip to the next section.

### What does async actually mean?

Asynchronous code is code where operations can give up control of a thread to allow other things to happen. Compare that with synchronous code, which waits for every operation to complete before starting the next one. Some languages (e.g. Node.js) are asynchronous by default, but other languages have asynchronous features that can be used when needed. If you're a JavaScript developer, you can probably skip this section.

If your code makes a request and has to wait a long time for a response, it might be worth writing your code asynchronously and allowing other things to happen until you receive a response. In the case of the Vonage Python SDK, we're making HTTP requests to a remote server. We're doing this synchronously, so it's worth considering if making an async version of part of the SDK would benefit my users. We can guess that making an async method would make it possible to send more requests at once with the SDK... but why guess? Let's do an experiment.

### Should we use async? A real-life example

To investigate if making some async methods would decrease the time taken to make requests, I wrote 2 pieces of code. One used a function from the Vonage Python SDK as normal to make 100 HTTP requests to the [Vonage Number Insight API](https://developer.vonage.com/number-insight/overview) and the other used an async version of the function that I created. I profiled both versions of the code ([using the profiling method I described in Part One of this series, here](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/22/11/15/improve-your-software-project-part-one-understanding-a-codebase#understand-the-call-stack-by-profiling-your-sample)) and we can see that the majority of the time spent in the program is spent making HTTP requests.

The first image below is an icicle plot that shows the top of the call stack for our SDK as it makes 100 requests to a Vonage API.

![The top of an icicle plot of a series of synchronous SDK operations](/content/blog/improve-your-software-project-part-three-next-level-enhancements/sync-icicle-plot-top.png)

The next image shows the very bottom of the call stack. As you can see here, most of the time the whole program takes to run (2.78/3.42 seconds, or 81%!) is spent just waiting for SSL connections between our code and the remote server. And that's just one part of the process where we have to wait when making sync calls.

![The bottom level of the same icicle plot, showing that most of the time is spent waiting for connections](/content/blog/improve-your-software-project-part-three-next-level-enhancements/sync-icicle-plot-bottom.png)

This suggests that if the code could give up control of the thread until connections are established, the runtime could be much shorter! Below is the data for an async version of the code, that performs the same 100 requests to the same API.

![An icicle plot of a series of asynchronous SDK operations - much faster](/content/blog/improve-your-software-project-part-three-next-level-enhancements/async-icicle-plot.png)

We can see from the plot above that the entire task was completed in 0.33s, about 10 times faster than the synchronous version! In this case, it makes sense for me to explore whether I should make my code async.

The last paragraph seems pretty non-commital, given that I just made the code 10x faster. Why wouldn't I want to immediately start async-ifying my code? Well, it can make things a lot more complicated.

### Drawbacks of async - should I use it?

Whilst async code works well in a lot of cases, there are significant drawbacks. To make my code async, I'd have to rewrite a lot of it. In Python, async coroutines behave very differently from regular methods; they have to be called and dealt with very differently.

Worse than that is the question of support. If I were to fully rewrite the entire library to make it async and release a new major version of the project (as we discussed in Part 2), I would force my users to rewrite all of their code that uses my SDK! If I didn't want to put my users through this ordeal, I would need to maintain synchronous and asynchronous versions of the same code, effectively doubling the size of the codebase. That's twice as much code to test, and if I wanted to add any new features I'd have to add them twice.

There are ways to lighten the load, but adding async support would still be a significant time investment. Overall, async is very powerful but consider carefully what the use cases are for your codebase. If you think there would be a very significant benefit, consider making things async, but consider it very carefully before committing to deliver it. And if you're a JavaScript programmer who read this section even though this is how your code works anyway, I hope this was insightful, or at least entertaining. 🤷

## Setting up automated tooling

If you want to invest in the long-term health of your project, you will probably want to set up tooling that helps you write your code, or gives you insight into aspects of it. I mentioned some tools in [Part One of this series](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/22/11/15/improve-your-software-project-part-one-understanding-a-codebase#tooling-that-can-help-you) but let's talk more practically now about applying automated tooling to your code.

Assuming your code uses version control, it's possible to set up tooling to run when code is pushed/PRs are made, etc. There are many tools to do this. In my case, the Vonage Python SDK uses [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), which is free for open-source projects hosted on GitHub, and even for private GitHub repos below a certain usage quota.

### Test running and code coverage

In my repo, [I've set up a GitHub Action](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-python-sdk/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml) that runs tests when a push or PR is made and calculates the code coverage. The advantage of using automation to do this is that I can test on multiple platforms and versions of Python without having to manually set up a VM for each platform and a new virtual environment for each Python version. I'd recommend setting up your tests to run in this way, as you can catch errors **before** they get into your production environment.

![Part of the GitHub Action that runs my tests on multiple platforms and multiple versions of Python, whenever I push code to the repo or make a PR](/content/blog/improve-your-software-project-part-three-next-level-enhancements/github-action-test.png)

### Mutation score

In [Part One of this series](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/22/11/15/improve-your-software-project-part-one-understanding-a-codebase#mutation-score) we briefly discussed the benefits that mutation testing can bring. It can be easy to fall into the code coverage trap of increasing coverage, no matter the cost. [Goodhart's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law) states that "when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure". Developers who get too invested in code coverage metrics tend to sacrifice test quality, for coverage quantity. Mutation score is a way to prevent this from happening.

Mutation score is related to the ability of your tests to be resilient to changes. As we discussed in Part One, mutation tests work by changing your code in subtle ways and then applying your unit tests to these new, "mutant" versions of your code. 

Mutation testing can take some time to run on a larger codebase. Luckily, though, because this is an automated testing method, it's possible to add mutation testing into a build/release pipeline. I decided to do this for the Vonage Python SDK, using a [Python mutation library called mutmut](https://github.com/boxed/mutmut).

I set up a "Mutation Test" GitHub Action that runs a mutation test on the codebase, as shown below:

![GitHub Actions console showing my mutation test workflow and some previously run jobs](/content/blog/improve-your-software-project-part-three-next-level-enhancements/mutation-test-runs.png)

This workflow has a manual run trigger. This is because an automated run on push or PR would take a longer time than I want to complete. Having the workflow manually triggered means that whenever I want to gain insight into the state of my codebase, I can run it.

![The mutation testing workflow is manually triggered](/content/blog/improve-your-software-project-part-three-next-level-enhancements/manual-trigger.png)

The mutation test workflow generates HTML output which it makes available for download inside the specific test run. This contains an index file showing an overview, and then a list of mutations that evaded detection for each module.

![The mutation test run produces an artifact containing the results in HTML format](/content/blog/improve-your-software-project-part-three-next-level-enhancements/mutation-artifact.png)

![Results from the run](/content/blog/improve-your-software-project-part-three-next-level-enhancements/mutation-artifact.png)

We can see here that we caught 383/522 mutant versions of the code or about 74%. This is a good amount, but we can see some discrepancies between modules and might want to investigate the cause of these. It's not always productive to try for the highest score (remember Goodhart's Law!) but we can use these metrics to better understand what our tests are doing. Having a mutation score that constantly improves (even if very slowly) is more important than having a high score.

### Vulnerability scanning

If your project uses dependencies, you should be confident that you're using versions of these that don't compromise the safety of your users. Many automated tools can check this for you, e.g. [Mend for GitHub.com](https://github.com/apps/mend-for-github-com), which periodically scans your code for vulnerabilities and raises issues and PRs to try and fix vulnerabilities.

![An issue automatically raised by mend-for-github-bot that highlights a potential vulnerability and remediation steps](/content/blog/improve-your-software-project-part-three-next-level-enhancements/security-issue.png)

Using a tool that tracks vulnerability databases and security advisories is important, as new threats are discovered all the time.

## Handing over the project

This series has focused mostly on the situation where you've started to work on a legacy project, but you probably won't be the one responsible for that project forever. At some point, you'll likely hand over the code to somebody else, and it's a good practice to use your final weeks with a project to make sure the handover goes as smoothly as possible. You might have heard the [rule adapted from the scouts by Bob Martin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/97-things-every/9780596809515/ch08.html): leave the code in a better state than you found it.

With 2 weeks until a handover, it's time to stop accepting any new work. Your job at this point should be to create a seamless handover. Finish or discontinue any features and merge or close any open PRs. Ideally, you want to get on to the important process of writing stuff down as soon as you can.

Document the state of the code. This includes making sure READMEs and docs are up to date, in case the code isn't touched for a while, but also: write a handover document! You don't want your successor to have to sift through many open branches of uncommitted code to work out what you were planning. Your handover document should include:

* An overview of the codebase
* How to get started with developing on the project
* Testing overview
* The work you started but didn't finish
* Work that you planned to do, and why
* Anything else that's undocumented or non-obvious

Finally, your successor might reach out to you to discuss the code. Consider engaging with them, if you have time. It's nice to be nice!
