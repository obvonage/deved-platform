## Another Video API, But Why?

Remember a not-so-distant past, in which video calls were cumbersome and awkward? Remember the need for external webcams? Remember when the promise of business calls amounted to one boardroom of people in suits talking to another boardroom of people in suits? Those days are over. Not only are folks having video calls with friends, family, and colleagues, but they're also preferring to meet businesses through video. According to Vonage's 2021 [Global Customer Engagement Report](https://www.vonage.com/resources/publications/global-customer-engagement-report/), 56% of consumers opt to video chat with businesses. In fact, there's been a 300% growth in the number of respondents who chose video chat as the number one channel for talking to companies. People are expecting a seamless, connected customer experience that includes video conferencing in a company’s toolbelt.

We built the Meetings API to meet this need. Just as video conferencing used to be cumbersome for users, it was even more painful for companies to integrate with their software. WebRTC is complicated. It's been around quite a while but it's still not easy to get going or scale. Vonage APIs help abstract the complicated parts of WebRTC without sacrificing performance or functionality. In addition to Vonage's other Video products ([VBC](https://www.vonage.co.uk/unified-communications), [Video API](https://tokbox.com/developer/guides/basics/), [Video Express](https://tokbox.com/developer/video-express/)), Meetings API offers another simplified, Low-Code option for companies who want to control their video experience and are looking for something in between Video SaaS & fully customizable APIs.

Simply put, Meetings API was built around experience. Customers now expect a video experience. Developers now expect a simple experience. Meetings API meets both these expectations.

## Code Simplicity

The Meetings API allows developers to "drop-in" a full video experience into their application. Just send the right request to the API and it will return the information about the room it has created.

To use the API, you need to authorize the request with a JSON Web Token (JWT). Use the [JWT Generator](https://developer.vonage.com/jwt) to create a JWT using the Application ID and Private Token mentioned above.

For further details about JWTs, please see [Vonage Authentication](https://developer.vonage.com/concepts/guides/authentication).

### Creating A Room

The API allows the creation of two types of rooms:

1. An Instant Room (or the default room) is created for meetings happening right now. It is active for ten minutes until the first participant joins the room and for ten minutes after the last participant leaves.

Sample request to create an instant room:

```
curl -X POST 'https://api-eu.vonage.com/beta/meetings/rooms'
-H 'Authorization: Bearer XXXXX'
-H 'content-type: application/json'
-d '{ "display_name":"New Meeting Room" }'
```

2. A Long Term Room, which remains alive until the specified expiration date (the maximum is one year). This room is typically linked to a recurring meeting, person, or resource.

Sample request to create an instant room:

```
curl -X POST 'https://api-eu.vonage.com/beta/meetings/rooms'
-H 'Authorization: Bearer XXXXX'
-H 'content-type: application/json'
-d '{ "display_name":"New Meeting Room", "type": "long_term", "expires_at": "2022-04-28T14:20:20.462Z", }'
```



#### Recording Configuration

Currently, the only configuration available for rooms are recording option by passing the additional `recording_options` object. You can decide if the session will be recorded with the `auto_record` boolean. Additionally, you can choose to only record the video of the room's owner (host) with the `record_only_owner` boolean.

An example of how to pass these options:

```
curl -X POST 'https://api-eu.vonage.com/beta/meetings/rooms'
-H 'Authorization: Bearer XXXXX'
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' 
-d '{
      "display_name":"New Meeting Room",
      "recording_options": {
        "auto_record": true,
        "record_only_owner": true
      }
    }'
```



### Successful Room Response

After successfully creating a Meeting Room, the API will return a response. The response contains the important _links object which holds both the host_url and the guest_url. These will be the links to send your users to the meeting, appropriately. Additionally, the response contains is_available which will be true unless the room has expired. The theme_id will be null until a theme is set.

An example of an instant room response:

```javascript
{
  "id": "ec1021f3-df34-4153-b7cb-aedd0f974405",
  "display_name": "My New Room",
  "metadata": null,
  "type": "instant",
  "expires_at": "2022-03-29T08:01:18.513Z",
  "recording_options": {
    "auto_record": false
  },
  "meeting_code": "641766519",
  "_links": {
    "host_url": {
      "href": "https://meetings.vonage.com/?room_token=641766519&participant_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6IjA3YTA5MmFmLTE5YWUtNDg5Ny05NzQ1LWI2YjJkNjk5N2YyMSJ9.eyJwYXJ0aWNpcGFudElkIjoiZWU0ZjRkMmQtMzEwMy00YjVmLThhYzgtYTY2NjgxMmU4ZGViIiwiaWF0IjoxNjQ4NTQwMjc4fQ.AhrsWT1tSWEjoN0xDAMjVrEMRmvBMcwUWyhsa4yLCrg"
    },
    "guest_url": {
      "href": "https://meetings.vonage.com/641766519"
    }
  },
  "created_at": "2022-03-29T07:51:18.514Z",
  "is_available": true,
  "expire_after_use": false,
  "theme_id": null,
  "initial_join_options": {
    "microphone_state": "default"
  }
}
```



### Website Embed

A meeting created through the API can be embedded into your website or application. To do this, generate the meeting link and create an iFrame using that link:

`<iframe src="Meeting link goes here" title="Embedded Meeting" allow="camera;microphone"></iframe>`

This is currently supported for both desktop and mobile applications using the following:

* Desktop - Supported on Firefox and Chrome based browsers.
* iOS 14+ - Supported on Safari, Edge or Firefox.

  * Embed Meetings in native iOS with [WKWebView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview)
* Android - Supported on Chrome or Samsung browser v14+.

Feature functionality depends on display sizes. See full functionality [here](https://developer.vonage.com/meetings/overview#website-and-app-embed).

You will also need to send an [email request to the Meetings API team](mailto:meetings-api@vonage.com) to whitelabel the domain of the website the iFrame is used in.



## Advanced Capabilities
