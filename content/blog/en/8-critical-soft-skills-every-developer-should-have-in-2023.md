## Introduction

2023 is here, and soft skills are in demand more than ever. What are soft skills? Soft skills are personal attributes that enable individuals to effectively navigate their environment, work well with others, and achieve their goals.

These skills are often called "people skills" and include communication, teamwork, and leadership. They are highly valued by employers in nearly every industry, as they help employees to build relationships, work effectively in teams, and contribute to a positive work culture.

Below are the top 8 soft skills that every developer should have in 2023.

## The Top 8 Soft-Skills

1. Leadership - is the process of guiding people from A to point B. You don’t need an official position (such as management) to demonstrate this.

An effective leader: 

* Defines a clear vision and strategy and inspires and motivates others to work towards achieving common goals.
* Can identify and nurture team members' strengths, which can help retain top talent and foster a culture of continuous learning and development.
* Sets the tone for the team or organization and can create a positive, inclusive, and collaborative culture.

What leadership skills can you start today?

* Gain trust by trusting your team - If you had a PR that needed to be reviewed while you were gone and logged in over your break to ensure that it went out, you should rethink if you trust your team.
* Be proactive about what's coming down the pipeline and nurture your team's strengths to get it done.
* Make decisions – You can be a natural leader by making informed decisions and not hesitating or delaying when a decision is needed.

2. Communication - is important because it allows people to exchange information and ideas, build relationships, and achieve common goals. 

An effective communicator: 

* Is the foundation of solid relationships, whether they are personal or professional. By communicating effectively, you can build trust, resolve conflicts, and strengthen your connections with others.
* Can articulate your thought process at work.
* Is highly valued in the workplace and can open doors to new job opportunities and promotions.

What communication skills can you start today?

* Give clear & concise updates at meetings - Start with a bulleted list of 3 items and follow the format of what it is, why it is essential, what needs to be done, and who will do it.
* Eye Contact, Facial Expressions, Body Language & Tone - Sometimes, what you don't say is what people remember. Try to arrive with a positive attitude no matter the task.
* Public Speaking, Story Telling & Persuasion - Begin with a team "learn and learn" and put together a slide deck explaining a feature. By doing so, you'll learn more about the program as you plan to explain it to others and be regarded as someone who wants to share it with their team.

3. Interpersonal Skills - are essential in both personal and professional settings, as they can help to build strong relationships, resolve conflicts, and foster a sense of collaboration and community.

A person that practices self-awareness typically:

* Understands the impact of one's own actions and words on others.
* Understands and shares the feelings of others.
  Finds mutually beneficial solutions to conflicts or differences.
* Can identify and resolve disputes constructively.

What self-awareness skills can you start today?

* Assertive but not aggressive - It is straightforward to "tell" someone to do something but being confident in your ask goes a long way to building team morale.
* Giving and receiving criticism well - Constructive criticism leads to a better overall result.
* Lighten up - Take your job seriously but also know when to have fun and lighten up. This will also help reduce burnout, which is relevant in our industry.

4. Mentorship - is someone who teaches or gives help and advice to a less experienced and often younger person. 

Being a good mentor: 

* Grows others on the team - not just themselves.
* It can be used as a scale for a job promotion.
* Offers self-reflection moments as you share your learnings with other mentees.

What mentorship skills can you start today?

* Obtain relevant experience - Before being a mentor, read books or articles on the topic to gain insights to become a better mentor.
* Being a trusted ally - Once your team can depend on you for other things, it is easier for them to trust you to be your mentor.
* Be an advocate for less experienced developers - take a stand for junior team members and "teach" vs. criticize.

5. Teamwork - is crucial because it can lead to better outcomes and increased productivity. 

Being a good teammate: 

* You can divide tasks and responsibilities to allow them to complete projects more efficiently.
* It can provide opportunities for team members to learn from one another and develop new skills.
* It can bring different viewpoints and approaches to problem-solving, which can lead to more effective solutions.

What teammate skills can you start today?

* Collaborate & cooperate - There are many opportunities to work with your teammates. You have to find them. If you can't find them, then ask how you can help.
* Take a Team-based, collectivistic view - Go into projects thinking about the best outcome for the team to deliver our business needs.
* Contribute to discussions outside of the personal area of expertise - Do you only know Node.js, and a teammate is asking about C#? Jump in and help in any way you can. Another language is interesting to learn.

6. Problem-solving - is essential because it helps individuals and organizations to identify and resolve issues and challenges in a timely and effective manner. 

Why should you focus on being a better problem solver?

* Because it involves evaluating options and choosing the best course of action, which can lead to better decision-making.
* It helps identify and resolve problems quickly and effectively.
* It allows you to solve problems effectively, leading to a sense of accomplishment and increased job satisfaction.

What problem-solving skills can you start today?

* Find a way to move the project forward (even if it means putting it off). It can be a simple status email with the next steps to take or current blockers or pulling in another teammate to give it a fresh set of eyes.
* Make informed decisions - Look at the current problems from various "lenses" before making the decision.
* Prepare and take a systematic & resourceful approach.

7. Flexible & Adaptability - this is important because it allows individuals and organizations to adapt to changing circumstances and demands.

Why should you focus on being flexible?

* It allows individuals and organizations to adapt to new situations and challenges, which can lead to increased success and competitiveness.
* It can help individuals and organizations to bounce back from setbacks and challenges more easily.
* It can help individuals and organizations think outside the box and create creative solutions to problems.

What kind of flexibility skills can you start today?

* Be open to new ideas and be trainable no matter the topic as it pertains to your job.
* Work well under deadlines and pressure even if that means asking for more time and providing a valid reason.
* Find new ways to do things - just because your  company did something one way ten years ago doesn't mean you have to keep doing it that way today. Research and utilize new methods that might not have existed back then.

8. Conflict management - is important because conflicts and disagreements are a natural part of human interaction. 

Why is conflict management critical? 

* It can help build trust and strengthen relationships within a team, fostering a sense of collaboration and community.
* Resolving conflicts promptly and effectively can prevent disruptions and increase productivity.
* It allows you to manage conflicts effectively, leading to a more positive work environment and increased job satisfaction.

What kind of conflict management skills can you start today?

* Don’t cause unnecessary conflict - some conflict is necessary, but much of it can be handled in a different way.
* Look for common ground and helpful solutions when presented with a conflict.
* Deal with conflict appropriately & productively - don't let conflict go unaddressed or unresolved. Work to ensure all parties understand the conflict and the proposed resolution.
