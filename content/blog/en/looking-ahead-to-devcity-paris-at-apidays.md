## What is DevCity  

We started in San Francisco, brought the [bingo party to London](https://developer.vonage.com/blog/22/11/08/devcity-came-to-london-and-here-is-what-went-down) and now we are hugely excited to bring the Vonage DevCity magic to Paris! Just in time for the festive season, the Vonage Developer Relations team are packing their bags and traveling to the French capital for three days of content, networking and fun. And you’re invited to join us! We’re giving away 300 tickets to apidays Paris* (each worth €599), so read on to find out how you can get involved at Cité des Sciences et de L’industrie on 14th, 15th and 16th December 2022.

## Vonage meets apidays Paris

Where better to base our activity in Paris than the world's leading API conference series - [apidays Paris](https://www.apidays.global/paris/). This three day extravaganza looks at the next 10 years of APIs, with the theme of Software, Society, Sovereignty, Sustainability. We look forward to joining hundreds of speakers from around the world, thousands of API enthusiasts and attending some of the many sessions on offer. 

Vonage is a Gold Sponsor of the conference, which means we have a great exhibition booth where we will be running our now hugely popular anagram challenge, with exclusive swag prizes on offer. Here you can also meet the team, have one on one platform demos and discuss your individual use cases for our suite of communication APIs. Ask the team here how you can unlock your DevCity ticket too! And if that’s not enough, you can also win a brand new iPad mini to take home after the event! 

Elsewhere at the conference we are running two content sessions;

* Vonage Developer Advocate Benjamin Aronov will be running a workshop titled ‘NoCode, LowCode, Boss Mode: Reimagining User Experience with AI Studio’. Whether for inbound or outbound customer engagement, after this workshop you'll walk away ready to build your first AI Studio agent.

14th December, 16:55, Stage 7

* Paris based VP Sales EMEA, Vonage’s David Darmon will also be taking to the stage, so stay tuned for more details of his session. 

16th December, 9:55, Stage 3

## DevCity Paris is for everyone 

After the final conference session on 15th December, the team will be ready and waiting to welcome devs in Paris to DevCity! Whether you’re attending apidays or not, all are welcome at our latest installment of content, networking and entertainment, hosted at Le Loft, in the Cité des Sciences et de L’industrie. 

Taking to the stage will be your emcee Benjamin Aronov, who will warmly welcome guests and kick off with an introduction to our APIs. We are then really excited to welcome Arnaud Lauret, Author of ‘The Design of Web APIs’ (and known as the API Handyman), for a fireside chat around enhancing developer experience when implementing APIs. Finally, our local-to-Paris Senior .NET Developer Advocate Guillaume Faas will be running a live demo showcasing how you can enhance your in-app communication with our Video APIs.

Following the content, we will be running a speed networking challenge, giving you the opportunity to find like-minded devs, kindred spirits and perhaps even your next all-important tech connection. 

Look out also for the exclusive DevCity swag, tasty food and refreshing cocktails. It’s not to be missed, [so register here](https://events.vonage.com/event/dcf6f721-125e-4cf6-ad28-378b694087aa/summary) while you can! 

## Une Soirée? Oui Oui S'il Vous Plaît!

When we heard that the conference was celebrating 10 years of apidays, we knew we had to be involved. So once we wrap up the fun at DevCity at 19:00 on 15th December, we invite you to join us at the official 10 Year Anniversary Soirėe at Cité des Sciences et de L’industrie! You can expect the very best in French cuisine with a 16 course Hors d”oeuvres extravaganza, a contemporary ballet performance from the Conservatoire Supérieur de Paris, a Big Ukulele Syndicate Concert AND a live DJ!  

Head to the Vonage VIP area for exclusive hospitality, even more great swag and the chance to take part in our selfie competition to win a €50 Apple Gift Card! Just look for the photobooth and grab a Vonage santa hat to take part.
